### Highlights
- **Floating Animated Tasks** – Tasks drift and bounce gently around the window with physics-based movement, variable speeds by priority, and smooth fade-in/out animations.
- **Priority System** – None, Low, Normal, High with distinct colors and speed multipliers. High-priority tasks appear in a scrolling ticker at the top.
- **Categories** – Unlimited custom categories + built-in "Default" and "Completed Tasks". Quick navigation with Q/E keys or combo box.
- **Task Interactions**
  - Left click / double-click: toggle normal/low priority
  - Right click: mark complete
  - Shift + right click: archive to Completed or permanently delete
  - Ctrl + click: lock/unlock (locked tasks get a gold glow and can't be modified)
  - Middle click: toggle high priority
- **Themes** – 12 built-in themes (Default, ClassicWindows, CherryBlossom, Matrix, MSDOS, Frozen, Spring, Summer, Spooky, Midnight, Rose, Gold) with instant switching.

- **Clock Overlay** – Optional real-time clock that floats independently with customizable font, color, and size.
- **Screensaver Mode** – Full-screen idle mode after configurable minutes (5–60) with enlarged tasks and slower movement.
- **Tray Support** – Minimize to system tray with icon, optional mute on minimize.
- **Startup & Persistence** – Optional run on Windows startup, start minimized, side panel open state preserved.
- **Undo** – Full undo support for add, delete, complete, priority, lock, and category changes (Z).
- **Import/Export** – CSV import/export for tasks and categories.
- **Custom Cursors** – 12 themed cursors + default arrow.
- **Highly Configurable** – Font family/size, colors for every priority/state, strikethrough completed, title bar options (category name, task counter, ticker), display presets (Small to X-Large).
