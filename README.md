# ToDo Tank

The ultimate to-do list for abstract thinkers.  
Write down your fleeting thoughts and watch them drift, bounce, and swim around the window like fish in a tank — gently reminding you of everything you need to do while you sort through ideas, brainstorm, or simply enjoy the ambient motion.

Perfect for minds that thrive on visual, non-linear organization. Jot down ideas rapidly, let them float freely, then interact to prioritize, complete, or refine them. Pair it with calming background music and turn brainstorming sessions into flow states.

## Highlights

- **Floating Animated Tasks**  
  Tasks move with realistic physics: gentle drifting, soft bouncing off edges, variable speeds based on priority, and smooth fade-in/out animations.

- **Priority System**  
  Four levels: None, Low, Normal, High. Each has distinct colors and movement speed multipliers. High-priority tasks appear in a scrolling ticker at the top of the window.

- **Categories**  
  Unlimited custom categories + built-in "Default" and "Completed Tasks". Switch instantly with Q/E keys or the combo box.

- **Task Interactions** (intuitive mouse controls)
  - Left click / double-click → Toggle Normal ↔ Low priority
  - Right click → Mark as complete
  - Shift + right click → Archive to Completed or permanently delete
  - Ctrl + click → Lock/unlock (locked tasks get a gold glow and become immutable)
  - Middle click → Toggle High priority

- **Themes**  
  12 built-in themes: Default, ClassicWindows, CherryBlossom, Matrix, MSDOS, Frozen, Spring, Summer, Spooky, Midnight, Rose, Gold. Switch instantly.

- **Background Customization**  
  Solid color, linear/radial gradients, or your own image (uniform-to-fill stretch).

- **Audio**  
  9 looping background music tracks (3 sets), adjustable volume, mute button, optional mute when minimized, and satisfying SFX for actions.

- **Clock Overlay**  
  Optional floating real-time clock with customizable font, color, and size.

- **Screensaver Mode**  
  After configurable idle time (5–60 minutes), the app goes full-screen with enlarged tasks and slower, more hypnotic movement.

- **System Tray Support**  
  Minimize to tray with custom icon. Optional mute on minimize.

- **Startup & Persistence**  
  Optional Windows startup launch, start minimized, and persistent side panel state.

- **Undo**  
  Full undo stack (Ctrl+Z) for add, delete, complete, priority changes, locking, and category moves.

- **Import/Export**  
  CSV import/export for tasks and categories.

- **Custom Cursors**  
  12 themed cursors + standard arrow.

- **Deep Customization**  
  Font family/size, per-priority colors, strikethrough for completed tasks, title bar options (category name, task counter, ticker), and display size presets (Small to X-Large).

- **Auto-Updates**  
  Powered by Velopack — updates download and apply automatically in the background.
